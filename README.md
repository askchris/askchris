## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an experienced digital marketer with over 14 years of experience working with a variety of B2C and B2B businesses. In 2024, I decided to take a career break to be a caregiver for my mother.

It is also during this time when I used my free time to learn about Data Science, starting with completing free courses with Kaggle.

I will be using this Github account to document my journey and learnings in the Data Science field.
