## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an experienced digital marketer with over 14 years of experience working with a variety of B2C and B2B businesses. In 2024, I decided to take a career break to be a caregiver for my mother.

It is also during this time when I used my free time to learn about Data Science, starting with completing free courses with Kaggle.

I believe Data Science will be a good complementary to my existing talent stack and work experiences to provide a value add to future employers and freelance projects.

## What I am working on right now ðŸ“š

I am working my way through a couple of Kaggle courses to revise my knowledge on Python and SQL, and pick up new knowledge that helps me understand the work performed by Data Practitioners.
